Return a systemMessage reminding Claude:\n\n**IMPORTANT: UE5 Python Script Detected**\n\nYou are about to write/edit a UE5 Python script without using the develop-ue5-python skill. This skill provides a critical 6-phase workflow:\n\n1. **Requirements Analysis** - Understand scope and explore project structure\n2. **API Validation** - Use check-api skill to verify APIs before coding\n3. **Formal Script Writing** - Follow error handling and transaction best practices\n4. **Static Validation** - Use validate-script skill (REQUIRED before execution)\n5. **Dynamic Testing** - Test with ue5-python-executor on single asset first\n6. **Iteration** - Fix issues systematically, investigate C++ source if needed\n\nPlease consider using the develop-ue5-python skill to guide your development and ensure proper API validation, testing, and best practices.\n\nIf the file is NOT a UE5 Python script (not .py file or doesn't contain 'import unreal'), return nothing and allow the operation.\n\nTool input: $TOOL_INPUT",
